This is a very simple backend for a solidity Auction contract. I built it so that once the auction contract is deployed there any person can deploy their oown auction on the
blockchain by creating an instance. Upon creating an auction instance you will have to choose a timeframe for how long the auction will go. All bidders must send their money to 
the contract address. One thing to note is that when placing a bid on top of a bid you already placed the value bid will be added to the amount already bid by the person. This is 
put in place because of the way the contract works with holding all the money bid. All the code should have comments and should be well explained.
