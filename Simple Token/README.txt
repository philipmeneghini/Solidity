This is a very simple implementation of an ERC-20 token on the ethereum blockchain. ERC-20.sol has the interface as it is laid out on ethereum.com with all the relevant 
functions included in EIP-20. This was the framework for my project which gave me the outline to a very basic token implementation.

SIM.sol takes the ERC-20 interface and creates a token called simple 'SIM'. This token was minted in the rinkeby test network by my account. The token has a set amount of 10,000 
tokens that are awarded to the founder on the deployment of the contract on the blockchain. It has all the required methods implemented so that it can be transfered, swapped, 
and awarded like all other ERC-20 tokens.
