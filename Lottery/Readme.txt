This is a simplified example of how you can deploy a lottery contract on the ethereum blockchain. This code should not be deployed on the mainnet at any time. It finds the 
winner of the lottery using a random number which is not actually random. Other than that this contract is a perfectly functional lottery contract which can be tested 
on any of the test nets at any point. It uses basic transactions and data structures in the solidity programming language so was a very rewarding beginning smart contract to 
develop.
